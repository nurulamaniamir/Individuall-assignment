            <p>A magnificent organisation will emerge if the committee members give the club their whole loyalty and attention. Since the secretarial line was imposed on us by the previous club president, no one can use any circumstance as an excuse to exclude the club. The truth is that through working together, we can not only learn how to manage the organisation but also identify our own strengths and weaknesses. We will work hard to correct our weaknesses and become better people than we were the day before during that time. This is due to the fact that a great individual corrects his own mistakes rather than pointing out those of others.</p>
