            <p>To be completely honest, I love my family. I want to briefly describe my family to you. My mother is the head clerk in the government, and my father is a retired engineer. We siblings do, in fact, comprehend our parents' weariness from working so hard to provide for us all. The two of them's services are too valuable to be returned in kind. In their forties and fifties, my parents are. I'm glad I had parents who care about me and my siblings all the time and don't neglect us. I have four siblings, two boys and two girls. They are all still eagerly and resolutely learning. My parents want nothing more than for their kids to one day prosper and lead fulfilling lives. The best family in the world is my family.</p>
